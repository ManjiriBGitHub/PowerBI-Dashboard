## Problem Statement
The objective of this eCommerce sales dashboard is to provide the store owner with real-time insights into sales performance, regional trends, customer behavior, and product success across India. This enables the owner to make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, customer retention, and overall profitability.

## Steps to Create the Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was built to provide insights into sales performance, profit, and customer behavior. Below are the steps and visualizations created to achieve this:

### [1] Sum of Profit by Months (Stacked Column Chart)

A stacked column chart was used to display the sum of profit for each month, enabling the analysis of monthly profit trends over time.

### [2] Profit by Subcategories (Stacked Bar Chart)

A stacked bar chart was created to show the distribution of profit across different product subcategories, helping identify which subcategories contribute the most to overall profitability.

### [3] Sum of Quantity by Category (Donut Chart)

A donut chart was used to represent the sum of quantities sold, broken down by product category, providing a quick view of category performance in terms of volume.

### [4] Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode (Donut Chart)

Another donut chart was created to visualize the sum of quantities sold by each payment mode, giving insights into the most commonly used payment methods.

### [5] Visual Cards for Key Metrics

Visual cards were added to display key business metrics, including:
Sum of Amount (Total Sales)
Sum of Quantity (Total Items Sold)
Sum of Profit
Average Order Value (AOV)
These cards provide a high-level overview of performance indicators.

### [6] Sum of Amount by States (Stacked Bar Chart)

A stacked bar chart was used to show the sum of sales amount by state, enabling a regional breakdown of revenue performance.

### [7] Sum of Amount by Customer Name (Line Graph)

A line graph was created to display the sum of sales amount by customer name, providing insights into the sales contribution of individual customers over time.

### [8] Filters Using Slicers (Quarters and State-wise)

Slicers were added to the dashboard to enable filtering by:
Quarters: Allows users to see sales, profit, and other metrics for specific quarters.
States: Filters data to show insights for individual states, enabling detailed regional analysis.
These filters help users explore insights for specific time periods and regions.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

  
### 1. Profit by Months
The months of January, March, August, October, and November show the highest profit. These months are performing well in terms of profitability, which may be due to seasonal trends, holidays, or successful promotions during this time.
- Suggestion: Focus on further boosting sales during these months by offering targeted discounts, promotions, or marketing campaigns, as they seem to already be profitable periods.

### 2. Profit by Subcategories
Printers, Bookcases, Sarees, Accessories, and Tables generate the highest profits, with Printers showing the maximum profit.
- Suggestion: Given the high profitability of these subcategories, it’s recommended to keep an optimal stock level of these items and consider promoting these products more aggressively to further increase sales and profits. Additionally, explore whether offering complementary products can drive more cross-sell opportunities.

### 3. Sum of Quantity by Categories
Clothing accounts for 63% of the total quantity sold, followed by Electronics at 21%, and Furniture at 17%.
- Suggestion: Since clothing dominates in terms of quantity, you can further capitalize on this by expanding the product range or running seasonal clothing promotions. At the same time, explore opportunities to grow sales in the electronics and furniture categories, perhaps through bundling or special offers.

### 4. Sum of Quantity by Payment Mode
Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular payment mode, accounting for 44% of all orders, followed by UPI (21%), Debit Cards (13%), Credit Cards (12%), and EMI (10%).
- Suggestion: Since COD is the most preferred payment option, it's important to ensure smooth and timely delivery of orders. At the same time, there’s an opportunity to encourage more digital payments (UPI, cards) by offering discounts or cashback on these methods to reduce reliance on COD.

### 5. Sum of Amount by States
The top 5 states contributing the most to sales revenue are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Rajasthan.
- Suggestion: Focus on maintaining strong marketing and distribution efforts in these states, as they are high-performing regions. Additionally, consider targeted campaigns or exploring opportunities in underperforming regions to expand the customer base in other parts of India.

### 6. Sum of Amount by Customer Name
The top 3 customers by spend are Harivansh, Mashav, and Madan Mohan, with Harivansh spending almost ₹10,000.
- Suggestion: These high-value customers represent a significant share of the business. Consider developing a loyalty program or offering personalized deals to retain them and encourage repeat purchases.

### 7. Overall Summary (Visual Cards)
- Total Sales (Sum of Amount): ₹438K
- Total Quantity Sold: 5615 items
- Total Profit: ₹37K
- Average Order Value (AOV): ₹121K
- Suggestion: The overall performance is strong, but there’s room for improvement in profit margins. Focus on optimizing costs, such as shipping and product sourcing, to improve profitability. Also, increasing average order value through cross-sells or upsells can enhance revenue.

## Key Suggestions
- Capitalize on High-Profit Months: Increase marketing and offers during January, March, August, October, and November.
- Promote High-Profit Products: Ensure stock availability and promote categories like Printers and Bookcases more.
- Optimize Payment Methods: Offer incentives for digital payments to reduce COD reliance.
- Expand in High-Contributing States: Continue to strengthen marketing in top-performing states while exploring new regions.
- Focus on High-Value Customers: Build loyalty programs for top spenders like Harivansh.
- These insights will help guide business decisions and improve overall sales and profitability.
